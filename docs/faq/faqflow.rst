Can you describe the general data flow in Kluster?
***************************************************

When you drag data into the Kluster GUI, it adds those files to the Intelligence module.  See the 'Learn more about Kluster - Kluster Intelligence' article.  The intelligence module makes all the processing decisions for you, so that you don't have to know if sv correction comes before georeferencing or after.  If the intelligence module has an available action, it shows in the Actions window in Kluster and you either hit the start button to run or check 'Auto' to automatically process.
