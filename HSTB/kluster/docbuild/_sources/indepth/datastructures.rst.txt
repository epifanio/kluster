Data Structures
***************

There are two main data structures in the Kluster software: the processed multibeam data (Fqpr) and the gridded dataset (Bathygrid).  Here we will talk about both of these in detail, as well as the lightweight project structure that holds both.  Let's start with an example:

.. image:: datastructures1.png
   :target: ../_images/datastructures1.png

Here we see the three main elements as they are generated in Kluster.

You drag in a new multibeam file, start the conversion process and see a new folder ("EM2040_40111_05_23_2017" in our case) appear next to the multibeam file with a similar entry in the Kluster application under 'Converted'.  This is the Fully Qualified Ping Record structure that Kluster uses to hold all the converted multibeam/sound velocity/positioning data as well as all the intermediate and fully processed multibeam records.

At the same time, a 'kluster_project.json' file, the project file, is created which holds your project settings and the paths to the different folders.  Unless you want to use the project file to manage large projects, this can basically be ignored, and you can just work with the data folders, dragging in new folders to view in Kluster.

Finally, after fully processing the data, you can create a new surface, which we show here as the 'vrtilegrid_mean' folder, which tells you that this is a VR surface created in Bathygrid using the 'mean' algorithm to determine the value in each cell of the grid.

Let's discuss each of these in more detail.

Fully Qualified Ping Record
===========================

The Fully Qualified Ping Record (FQPR) is the data structure that contains all of the converted, intermediate and final multibeam data.  When converting data through the GUI (which uses the Kluster Intelligence module), each converted folder represents one FQPR object, which represents one sonar for one day's worth of data.

"EM2040_40111_05_23_2017" = A Kongsberg EM2040 with serial number 40111 with data only during the day of May 23, 2017

You can actually use Kluster to just convert any lines to a folder, but the Kluster GUI forces you to use this scheme.  This allows you to drag in files from anywhere, knowing nothing about where they come from or which sensor they belong to, and Kluster will automatically organize them into neat little datasets.

So let's talk about what is in one of these FQPR objects.  We'll use the console to reload a processed FQPR dataset and print the summary. Note that 'reload_data' is the function used to reload FQPR data when you drag the folder into the GUI as well.  I'm just showing it on the console to illustrate a few things.

.. code-block:: python

The print out summary for the FQPR record shows some of the useful attributes for the object.  You can access them pretty readily using the properties as well.

.. code-block:: python

    > fq.min_time
    Out[5]: 'Tue Mar 17 06:28:55 2020 UTC'

    > fq.max_time
    Out[6]: 'Tue Mar 17 09:51:22 2020 UTC'

    > fq.sonar_model
    Out[7]: 'em2040'

    > fq.status
    Out[8]: 'tpu'

To get at the data however, you'll need to access the multibeam object.  The multibeam object contains the Xarray Datasets for the ping records and the attitude records, which are the two datasets contained within the FQPR data structure.

This corresponds to the folders within the "EM2040_40111_05_23_2017" folder.  You'll see they are saved in the zarr format, which is a compressed chunked data format.  There are matching 'sync' folders, which are there for file locking and multiprocessing access.

You might have noticed that raw_ping is a list.  Each sonar head corresponds to an element in the list, for most sonars that only have one head this will always be a single element list.

Xarray allows you to do things like quickly interpolate one dataset to the coordinates of another.  A common thing you might want to do is get the attitude records for the nearest ping time.  You might ask why the two datasets are kept separate in the first place.  I use the full attitude record to get the attitude during the ping across the array, which I found to improve the accuracy of the beam vector generation.  Anyway, to get the attitude at ping time, you simply:

.. code-block:: python

The dataset is organized into three main containers: coordinates, variables and attributes.

Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^

Attributes is the simplest, and powers the attributes window in the Kluster GUI.

Coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^

The coordinates are simply the data for the time/beam/xyz dimensions.  Time is the time of ping, beam is the beam number, and xyz is the 3d vector only used for the TX and RX variables.

When you isolate a variable, it will provide the variable data as well as the coordinates of the variable.  For instance, 'beampointingangle' is the raw beam angle in degrees for each beam.  It is a two dimensional array, with a value for each ping for each beam.  So the display for beampointingangle shows the two coordinate arrays as well.

     'dtype': dtype('float32')}

Finally, here is a brief description of each variable, and the information it contains:

- acrosstrack - The result of running Sound Velocity Correct in Kluster.  This is the acrosstrack (perpendicular to vessel movement) distance to the beam footprint on the seafloor from the vessel reference point in meters.
- alongtrack - The result of running Sound Velocity Correct in Kluster.  This is the alongtrack (vessel direction) distance to the beam footprint on the seafloor from the vessel reference point in meters.
- altitude - From the raw multibeam data, the logged altitude data from the navigation system in meters.  Relative to the ellipsoid chosen in the navigation system setup.
- beam - an array of beam numbers for each beam in the ping, starting with 0
- beampointingangle - The raw beam angle that comes from the multibeam data.  Angle in degrees from the receiver to the beam footprint on the seafloor, does not take attitude or mounting angles into account.
- corr_altitude - If this dataset is processed to the waterline this will be zero.  Otherwise, the altitude correction is the attitude rotated lever arm between the reference point of the altitude and the transmitter, if non-zero.  This will be the original altitude plus this correction.
- corr_heave - If this dataset is processed to the ellipse this will be zero.  Otherwise, the heave correction is the attitude rotated lever arm between the reference point of the heave and the transmitter, if non-zero. This will be the original heave plus this correction.
- corr_pointing_angle - The result of running Compute Beam Vectors in Kluster.  This is the raw beam angles corrected for attitude and mounting angles, relative to nadir (straight down from sonar).
- counter - The identification number assigned to each ping.  For Kongsberg .all, this is a 16bit number, so you will see it reset at 65536.
- datum_uncertainty - Included when VDatum is used for vertical transformation to NOAA Chart Datums, is the uncertainty of that transform.  Will be all zeros if NOAA_MLLW/NOAA_MHW is not selected.
- delay - The time delay applied to each sector, expanded to the beam dimension.  Comes from the multibeam raw data.  Generally fairly small, or zero.
- depthoffset - The result of running Sound Velocity Correct in Kluster.  This is the down (positive down) distance to the beam footprint on the seafloor from the transmitter in meters.  Not from the vessel reference point to align with Kongsberg svcorrect convention.  We apply the z lever arm in georeferencing.
- detectioninfo - The accepted/rejected state of each beam.  3 = re-accepted, 2 = rejected, 1 = phase detection, 0 = amplitude detection.  See Kongsberg "detectioninfo".
- frequency - The frequency of each beam in Hz.
- geohash - The computed base32 representation of the geohash, a code that defines the location of each beam in a region. Plotting will show the unique integer identifier instead of the string, for visualization purposes.
- latitude - From the raw multibeam data, the logged latitude data from the navigation system in degrees.
- longitude - From the raw multibeam data, the logged longitude data from the navigation system in degrees.
- mode - The first mode value. (if TX Pulse Form) CW for continuous waveform, FM for frequency modulated, MIX for mix between FM and CW. (if Ping mode) VS for Very Shallow, SH for Shallow, ME for Medium, DE for Deep, VD for Very Deep, ED for Extra Deep.
- modetwo - The second mode value. (if Pulse Length) vsCW = very short continuous waveform, shCW = short cw, meCW = medium cw, loCW = long cw, vlCW = very long cw, elCW = extra long cw, shFM = short frequency modulated, loFM = long fm. (if Depth Mode) VS = Very Shallow, SH = Shallow, ME = Medium, DE = Deep, DR = Deeper, VD = Very Deep, ED = Extra deep, XD = Extreme Deep, if followed by "m" system is in manual mode.
- ntx - The number of sectors in each ping
- processing_status - The Kluster processing status of each beam, the highest state of the beam.  EX: If 3, sounding is only processed up to sound velocity correction. 0 = converted, 1 = orientation, 2 = beamvector, 3 = soundvelocity, 4 = georeference, 5 = tpu.
- qualityfactor - The raw uncertainty record that comes from the multibeam.  Corresponds to the Kongsberg detectioninfo (.all) detectiontype (.kmall).  See datagram description for more information.
- rel_azimuth - The result of running Compute Beam Vectors in Kluster.  This is the direction to the beam footprint on the seafloor from the sonar in radians.
- rx - the computed receive vector representing the orientation of the sonar receiver, generated during the Orientation process
- sbet_altitude - From the imported post processed navigation, the exported altitude data in meters.  Relative to the ellipsoid chosen in the post processing software.
- sbet_down_position_error - From the imported post processed navigation, the logged down position error from the navigation system in meters.
- sbet_east_position_error - From the imported post processed navigation, the logged east position error data from the navigation system in meters.
- sbet_heading_error - From the imported post processed navigation, the logged heading error data from the navigation system in degrees.

- sbet_longitude - From the imported post processed navigation, the logged longitude data from the navigation system in degrees.
- sbet_north_position_error - From the imported post processed navigation, the logged north position error data from the navigation system in meters.
- sbet_pitch_error - From the imported post processed navigation, the logged pitch error data from the navigation system in degrees.
- sbet_roll_error - From the imported post processed navigation, the logged roll error data from the navigation system in degrees.
- soundspeed - The surface sound velocimeter data, in meters per second.
- thu - The Hare-Godin-Mayer TPU model - horizontal component.  In meters, 2sigma value.
- tiltangle - Steering angle of the sector transmit beam, in degrees.
- time - The time of each ping in UTC seconds
- traveltime - The two way travel time of each beam in seconds.
- tvu - The Hare-Godin-Mayer TPU model - vertical component.  In meters, 2sigma value.
- tx - the computed transmit vector representing the orientation of the sonar transmitter, generated during the Orientation process
- txsector_beam - The sector number of each beam.
- x - The result of running Georeference in Kluster.  This is the sound velocity offsets projected into the coordinate reference system you chose.  Easting is in meters.
- xyz - coordinate array for the tx and rx variables, length 3 array representing the three dimensional nature of these vectors
- y - The result of running Georeference in Kluster.  This is the sound velocity offsets projected into the coordinate reference system you chose.  Northing is in meters.
- yawpitchstab - Tells you whether yaw/pitch stabilization was enabled on the sonar.  Y = Only yaw stab, P = Only pitch stab, PY = Pitch and yaw stab, N = Neither.
- z - The result of running Georeference in Kluster.  This is the sound velocity offsets projected into the coordinate reference system you chose.  Depth is in meters from the vertical reference you chose.

Bathygrid
=========

Bathygrid is the Python module I developed to fit this role, of gridding multibeam soundings in such a way as to support billions of soundings over large areas while being memory and computation efficient.  Bathygrid leverages Dask and Zarr as well, so it shares a lot of the same elements as the FQPR object.  The three fundamental elements of the Bathygrid object are the points, the attribution and the grid itself.

To get access to the Bathygrid grid, you do the same thing we did with the FQPR object.  You either drag in the folder to Kluster, or use the load convenience method to load from disk.

.. code-block:: python

    > from HSTB.kluster.fqpr_convenience import reload_data

    > bg = reload_surface(r"C:\collab\dasktest\data_dir\outputtest\vrtilegrid_mean")

    > bg
    Out[4]:

    EPSG: 6339
    Path: C:\collab\dasktest\data_dir\EM2040_Fairweather_SmallFile\vrtilegrid_mean
    Bathygrid Version: 1.1.3
    Resolutions (meters): [8.0]
    Containers: em2040_40111_05_23_2017_0
    Mean Depth: 88.715
    Minimum Northing: 5292544.0 Maximum Northing: 5293312.0
    Minimum Easting: 538880.0 Maximum Easting: 539392.0

You can see that we get a similar representation to the FQPR object, and can access this same data using the attributes of the class:

.. code-block:: python

    > surf.min_x
    Out[6]: 538880.0

    > surf.min_time
    Out[7]: '2017-05-23T18:11:19'

    > surf.container
    Out[8]: {'em2040_40111_05_23_2017_0': ['0009_20170523_181119_FA2806.all']}

You can see a similar display of the attributes in the Attributes winwdow in Kluster, when you click on the surface in the Project Tree.

Points, Tiles and Grids
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section is best explained by a picture.  The image below shows the relationship between points, tiles and grids/cells.

.. image:: datastructures5.png
   :target: ../_images/datastructures5.png

To define these terms:

- SRGrid/VRGridTile - Single/Variable resolution structures that hold tiles or grids depending. The Root of the grid.
- Tile - a structure that holds cells and points. A SRGrid only contains Tiles and is of the same resolution throughout
- Grid - a structure that holds Tiles (SRGrid is a Grid), the VRGridTile basically holds miniature SRGrids within it
- Cell - a unit of the Tile that has a depth, uncertainty, etc. based on the points within it
- Point - a multibeam sounding

You can also see those relationships between the Root, Tile and Grid by looking at the folder structure.  Here we have the folder structure for our variable resolution grid.  The Root folder contains the Grids, each Grid folder contains one Tile, and each Tile contains points (data) and cell data (cells)

.. image:: datastructures6.png
   :target: ../_images/datastructures6.png

Using the console is similar:

.. code-block:: python

    > first_grid = surf.tiles[0][0]
    > first_grid

    first_grid_tile.cells
    {8.0: {'depth': dask.array<from-npy-stack, shape=(32, 32), dtype=float32, chunksize=(32, 32), chunktype=numpy.ndarray>,
           'density': dask.array<from-npy-stack, shape=(32, 32), dtype=int32, chunksize=(32, 32), chunktype=numpy.ndarray>,

           'horizontal_uncertainty': dask.array<from-npy-stack, shape=(32, 32), dtype=float32, chunksize=(32, 32), chunktype=numpy.ndarray>}}

Grids in the root, a Tile in each grid, and soundings and cells in the Tile.  This is the basic architecture of the Variable Resolution Bathygrid object.  The Single resolution is simpler, with just Tiles and soundings.

Note that all data is available as a Dask array, as data added is immediately flushed to disk to conserve memory.

Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^

Attributes are stored in JSON within the data structure.  The attributes that you see in the Attributes window in Kluster are the result of running return_attribution to gather the attributes from the Bathygrid structure.
